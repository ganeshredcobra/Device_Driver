In mutifile the difference is in Makefile 
Sometimes it makes sense to divide a kernel module between several source files. Lets say you have 2 source files :
start.c and stop.c
you can create a Makefile like this :

obj-m += startstop.o
startstop-objs := start.o stop.o

COMPILATION
===========

To compile, as root use make in the working directory of the code:

  # make

TESTING
=======

To load the module, do (as root):

  # insmod final.ko 

You can check for an entry for the module (if it is loaded) from the output of:

  # lsmod | grep final

To remove the module, do (as root):

  # rmmod final

Kernel log messages can be viewed from the output of dmesg.

To cleanup the compiled modules, use:

  # make clean
